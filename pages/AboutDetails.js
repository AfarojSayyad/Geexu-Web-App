    heading:" We prioritize trust",
    Info:" Making the decision to do business together involves extending mutual trust.No amount of due diligence can eliminate the uncertainty that comes with starting a new relationship ,trusting someone is a matter of faith, and we want to work with people who are willing to take that risk.We extend the presumption of good faith in all interactions based on trust, and we expect it in return."

    heading:" Empathize relentlessly",
    Info:"People-first is business-first, and showing empathy and building an extraordinary company are inextricably linked.Active listening, giving space, responding with intention, and pushing through surface conversations to the heart of the matter are all aspects that illustrate this value. Uncomfortable conversations become opportunities for mutual growth when your goal is to understand and care for someone.",

    heading:"Practice benevolent ambition",
    Info:"We strive to improve ourselves not so that we can get a bigger slice of the pie, but so that we can pay it forward and inspire others to do the same.We all know that mentoring benefits both the mentor and the mentee.Similarly, our apprenticeships, conference talks, and open-source work contribute to the strength of our community while also providing a venue for us to keep our skills sharp and our minds occupied.",

    heading:"Be compassionate, speak truth, and don’t put it off",
    Info:"We're kind and considerate, but we also try to tell the truth,even if it's difficult. There's a time to be light and airy, and then there's a time to take someone aside and be honest about something important.The longer you wait, the more difficult it will become, so be direct, be specific,and act now.",

    heading:"Avoid hustle culture",
    Info:" Our society's deification of 'hard work' must be put to rest once and for all.Work is a crucial part of life, but it does not have to be painful.That person who was 'first to arrive, last to leave' should get a therapist or a dog instead of a trophy. We aim higher: show up, put in a good and focused day's work, move on to something else, and then show up rested and ready the next day.If you think sending an email at 3 a.m. is a sign of dedication, you're probably not a good fit for Geexu, either as an employee or as a client.",

    heading:"Bizarre means captivating",
    Info:"Geexu actively recruit people who add spice to our lives.Work is a lot more fun when you're surrounded by fabulous weirdos who aren't afraid to bring their entire selves to work, including (especially) the nerdy parts.We appreciate it when they are willing to teach us about their interests, and we make time for this exchange of ideas during company hours.",

    heading:"You’ve already made it",
    Info:"Being an expert does not imply knowing all of the answers.It entails having the knowledge, experience, and confidence to ask probing questions and apply your knowledge creatively. When an unfamiliar term or acronym comes up in conversation, don't ignore it because you're afraid asking for clarification will make you look foolish. Creating a shared understanding is far more important than proving your intelligence. That is something we already know about you.",

    heading:"Wellness is a collaborative process ",
    Info:"It's sometimes easier to help someone else than it is to help yourself.Rather than fighting this perverse tendency, we use it to our advantage by normalizing the instinct to care for and protect our peers. When we notice someone is struggling, we reach out to them while respecting their privacy and autonomy. Whether you have the flu or a bad mental health day, the treatment is the same: take a break, rest, and return to work when you're feeling better.",
